Will try on my own to do the changes
First try, HERE WE GO!!!
GREAT!!! The pull WORKED!!!!

NOw, let's try to commit locally and push...
Learned that if the readme file is not created along with the repository, the changes will NOT commit. I will have to use PUSH to make the changes
will not appear
